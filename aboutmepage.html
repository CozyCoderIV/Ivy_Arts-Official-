                        <p>"You have to beat the best to be the best."- Floyd Mayweather. Ever since the age of 3, I've always been a creator. I've always kept some form of artistic medium in front of me. Initially, being an artist wasn't any vision set in plan I had for myself. Coming home from school during my early childhood years, making fan art of my favorite cartoon characters was just a hobby. I guess that's how all professions begin. Drawing and being cretaive was "just a hobby" until it wasn't. "The Spark" occured when I was at the age of 8 in my second grade of elementary school. </p>
                        <p>I remember this very vividly that my second grade teacher at the time was a vocal advocate of utilizing creativity. She held an artistic competition in class because unlike the norm, I wasnt the only kid who could draw at the time. Matter of fact there was a new transfer student who all the kids in class said was 'better than me'. I heard this day in and day out. The day of the competition, he was clearly the winner and had more skill than me. Me coming in second place losing didn't initialize the spark. It was the brash way the new transfer student after the competition called my piece of artwork which I spent so much time and effort on "trash".</p>
                        <p>Ever since that day, the realization of how I fealt about my art which led to me finding a purpose at a young age. That event lit a spark in me to push forward and never hear anyone call my pieces of passion trash and instead admire them. To this day I'm my only critic and I continue to shock and amaze peers around me thus earning the respected title of " the artist" which granted me requests to do more comisions than I can count by the time I hit middle school. </p>

                            <p>Ask any of my peers or family around me, the spirit of hard work and effort was built in me at a young age whether it was through sports, education, or in the artistic scope. When I turned 5, my biggest idol at the time was Spider Man. My uncle who is responsible for introducing me at a young age, Marvel and DC comics held a huge hold over me as a youngster from the ages of 5-10. This could very well be seen from a birds eye view on my life through numerous occasions and the large amount of photos my mother has of me as a child. Every pose for any picture I took in those years was the iconic web-slinger hand sign. My room was decorated as Spider Man themed, my pj's, even all of my prior birthdays until the age of 5 were Spider Man themed. I remember watching all of the Tobey Maguire movies on repeat. I want to give a HUGE thank you to Stan Lee for creating a character that would one day turned out to be the first influence over one of the upcoming greatest artists of all time.</p>
